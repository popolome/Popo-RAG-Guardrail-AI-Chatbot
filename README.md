To build an Enterprise-Ready RAG(Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) Chatbot with Intent Guardrails

<br>

I was inspired by production-grade bots like [Scenario's AI](https://www.scenario.com/), I implemented a custom prompt-engineering layer to ensure the model remains grounded. If a user provides 'gibberish' or off-topic prompts, the system is designed to gracefully redirect them back to the documentation.
